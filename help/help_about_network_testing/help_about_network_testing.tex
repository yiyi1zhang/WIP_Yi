\section*{About Network Testing}

In the third tab \textit{Network Visualization}, you can perform prediction for a pre-trained neural network. At first, you need to select a network model in the format of HDF5 from path or load the one from workspace if you have just trained it. This path will be used as the prediction output path for the later usage. Then, you can select test datasets either from workspace or from a path. If you want to use a new dataset, you should at first go back to the second tab \textit{Network Training} and perform patching image. In another way, if you want to use a dataset in storage, you can choose it from path. Then click \textit{Execution} to perform prediction.
